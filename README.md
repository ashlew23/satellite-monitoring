This project evaluates a YOLOv8-based object detection model trained on satellite imagery to assess its suitability for scalable environmental monitoring. Using a dataset of labeled remote sensing images, I tested the model’s ability to classify scenes across diverse land types—such as ports, parking lots, beaches, cities, and forests—achieving an overall mAP@0.5 of 0.760. The workflow supports scalable analysis through batch processing and is designed to inform real-world governance applications in urban planning, coastal monitoring, and infrastructure development.
